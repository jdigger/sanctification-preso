* From God

== The nature of God

== In the Beginning

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1&version=NIV[Genesis 1:1,26-27,31] In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth... Then God said, "`Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.`" So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female he created them... God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day.

== Familiar verses, but what do you get from them?

* God was the beginning, and Creator of all things (see also https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+1:3&version=NIV[John 1:3])
* Humanity was made in God's image
* "`and it was very good`"
* ...

== The Throne Room

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+6%3A1-5&version=NIV[Isaiah 6:1-5]: In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne... Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. And they were calling to one another: "`Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.`" ... "`Woe to me!`" I cried. "`I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.`"

== Unholy can not taint the Holy

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Samuel+6%3A1-6&version=NIV[2 Samuel 6:1-6] David... and all his men went to Baalah in Judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the Name, the name of the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the cherubim on the ark. They set the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from the house of Abinadab... Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart with the ark of God on it... David and all Israel were celebrating with all their might before the Lord... When they came to the threshing floor of Nakon, Uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of God, because the oxen stumbled. The Lord's anger burned against Uzzah because of his irreverent act; therefore God struck him down, and he died there beside the ark of God.

== There are entire books of the Old Testament talking about the need to be set apart -- consecrated -- or there are horrible consequences

== But that's all in the past.  On this side of the New Testament, God's much more chill

== Right?
== Not abolishing the Law

Remember https://jdigger.github.io/justification-preso/[as we talked about last time] the start of the Sermon on the Mount?

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-48&version=NIV[Matthew 5:17,20,48] "`Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them... For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven... Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.`"

== Righteous? Perfect?

We used the term "`holy`" many times before, but didn't define it

== Minor Rewording

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A17-48&version=NIV[Matthew 5:17,20,48] "`Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them... For I tell you that unless your pass:[<b><u>holiness</u></b>] surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven... Be pass:[<b><u>holy</u></b>], therefore, as your heavenly Father is pass:[<b><u>holy</u></b>].`"


== A Living Sacrifice

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12%3A1&version=NKJV[Romans 12:1] I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.

== Be ye Holy
[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+1%3A15-16&version=NIV[1 Peter 1:15-16] But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: "`Be holy, because I am holy.`"

He's quoting Leviticus 11:45, which is in the middle of a book talking about all the ways God was setting His people apart as a holy people (the Levitical Laws), and how serious He is about it

== What's all this about Holiness? Isn't this about Sanctification?

== Sanctify definition

image::sanctify_definition.png[]

== Wait, I'm certainly not Holy...

Yes, you are.  That IS the Gospel.  We are Holy in God's sight, https://jdigger.github.io/justification-preso/[as we talked about the last time]

== Now Be Whose Who Are

You are a Child of the King, created in His image; of infinite dignity, value, and worth

Christ paid the price of your sin with His life and blood

== Live like you actually BELIEVE that

== Giving Thanks to the Father

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A1-17&version=NIV[Ephesians 5:1-17] Follow God's example, therefore, as dearly loved children and walk in the way of love, just as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God. But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or of any kind of impurity, or of greed, because these are improper for God's holy people... For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light... Be very careful, then, how you live -- not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil... Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

== Be Thankful

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2018:21-35&version=NIV[Matthew 18:21-35] [Jesus answered,] "`Therefore, the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants... A man who owed him ten thousand bags of gold was brought to him. Since he was not able to pay... the servant fell on his knees before him. '`Be patient with me,`' he begged, '`and I will pay back everything.`' The servant’s master took pity on him, canceled the debt, and let him go. But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred silver coins... His fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him, '`Be patient with me...`' But he refused... Then the master called the servant in... In anger his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured, until he should pay back all he owed.`"

== Faith Without Works is Dead

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-19&version=NIV[James 2:14-19] What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to them, "`Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,`" but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. But someone will say, "`You have faith; I have deeds.`" Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.

== A Slave to Sin

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+7%3A14%E2%80%9325&version=NIV[Romans 7:14-25] We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do; but what I hate, I do... Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it. So I find this law at work: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me... What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!

== Born Again -- To Grow

Christ Justified us to Himself.  When we believe that, https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5%3A17&version=NKJV[we are reborn (2 Cor 5:17)]

Sanctification is His setting us apart (holy and consecrated), https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+3%3A18&version=NIV[growing in grace]

== Thankfully, even that is from God

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A23&version=NKJV[1 Thessalonians 5:23] Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.

== Holy and Blameless

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians+5%3A25-27&version=NIV[Ephesians 5:25-27] Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy, cleansing her by the washing with water through the word, and to present her to himself as a radiant church, without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish, but holy and blameless...

== Firm to the End

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%201&version=NIV[1 Corinthians 1:2,8] To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be his holy people, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ... He will also keep you firm to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ...

== Temptation that is common to Mankind

[quote.bible]
https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+10&version=NIV[1 Corinthians 10:12-13,23-24] So, if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don't fall! No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it... "`I have the right to do anything,`" you say -- but not everything is beneficial. "`I have the right to do anything`" -- but not everything is constructive. No one should seek their own good, but the good of others.
